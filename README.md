Spatial Landscape Simulation and Analysis using rflsgen in R:
this project focuses on simulating and analyzing spatial landscapes using the rflsgen package in R. The goal is to generate diverse landscape patterns with varying spatial configurations and analyze their structural characteristics using landscape metrics.

Based on JUSTEAU‐ALLAIRE, Dimitri, BLANCHARD, Grégoire, IBANEZ, Thomas, LORCA, Xavier, VIEILLEDENT, Ghislain et BIRNBAUM, Philippe.
